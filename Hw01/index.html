			About Seungkyun
		</h1>

		<p>
			I am a second year in DT, totally lost in terms of what to do with thesis... I like cats and sloths. I think my new upcoming obsession is going to be either otters or llamas. 
			<br><br>
			I decided to take Web 3 as I wanted to see what it is about web that mesmerizes so many people. A lot of my friends in DT are obsessed with web, and they say web is like the universe, the ocean...everything. So I wanted to take this course to see what there is in the web world, especially beyond just making things look pretty. I am excited to see where this goes.
