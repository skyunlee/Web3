				Welcome to Llama Llama!<br>
				Llamas are wonderful curious creatures. I love llamas because they are so soothing to look at. Their neckline is as graceful as that of a swan and their fluffy wool looks as soft as cotton candy.

				The best part about llamas, if you ask me, is their name--llama. The double "L" at the front is so special and unique. The word sounds very happy too! It's therapeutic to repeat "llama llama" out loud. Try it out when you're feeling stressed :)

		<article class="about_llama">
			<p>
				The llama is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since pre-Hispanic times. (--Wikipedia)
				<br><br>
				Llamas are quiet, gentle and friendly animals.  They live with other llamas as a herd. They are also very intelligent and easy to train--they are able to learn simple tasks after a few repititions. In addition, they don't smell bad for outdoor animals!
				<br><br>
				Llamas and alpacas are very similar to each other. Alpacas are llamas' smaller cousins, bred primarily for fleece.
