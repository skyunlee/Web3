	I am a second year in DT, interested in topics such as physical to digital interface, interactive installations, responsible design and mobile applications. My interests are constantly broadening, so I'm having trouble narrowing down domains of interest for thesis these days.
	<br>
	I decided to take Web 3 as I wanted to see what it is about web that mesmerizes so many people. A lot of my friends on DT are so obsessed with web, and they say web is like the universe, the ocean, and everything. So I wanted to take this course to see what there is in the web world, especially beyond just making things look pretty. I am excited to see where I end up at the end of this course.
